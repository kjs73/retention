Retention
=========

Water retention model Monte Carlo simulation.
Implements the basic water retention model discussed in
http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6166,
http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.0425, and
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2082.

Setting BOOSTPATH to point to a recent boost release and using the CMake file should be enough to compile the program.
